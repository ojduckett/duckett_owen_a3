  <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:left;padding:20px"> My name is Owen Duckett. I am 19 years of age and I am from Pickering, Ontario, Canada. I am currently a second-year University of Waterloo student studying in the Global Business and Digital Arts program (GBDA). The purpose of this website is to give a brief overview of who I am and what I am passionate about. I will include a collection of photos, insightful descriptions, and some platforms where you can follow me and stay up to date with what I am up to.

  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:verdana;font-size:300%;"> About Me </h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:left;padding:20px">Going more in-depth, my overall personality can be defined by 3 words, Creative, Passionate, and Supportive. When I’m not focused on school and studying I have loads of things I am passionate about. Sports and Travel have to be the 2 main topics I am always immersed in. Besides these 2 topics, I also enjoy video games. My friends and I sometimes run and organize tournaments for certain competitive games and we also sometimes compete in them. Finally, whenever it’s possible I am also listening to music. I like a variety of genres such as rap, hip-hop, pop, and many more. Moving forward, if you are interested in contacting me I am available on Instagram @owenjduckett and my Email is owen.duckett@gmail.com

  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:verdana;font-size:300%;"> Travel </h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:left;padding:20px">As previously mentioned, I love to travel. I am grateful and fortunate enough to have travelled to different continents across the globe, as well as experienced multiple new and diverse cultures. It’s very difficult to pick a certain country that was my favourite to visit, but I have loved Europe everytime I have been there. The locations from the photos in order are 1. London, England 2. Prague, Czech Republic 3. Kraków, Poland 4. Luxembourg City, Luxembourg 5. Interlaken, Switzerland 6. New York City, USA. When travelling I try to immerse myself in the culture, I attempt to visit important locations, try different food and cuisines, and participate in new activities. In addition, I also tie in my love for sports with travel. I have been to insane stadiums to view different sporting events in various cities such as New York, Cleveland, London, and many more. Looking to the future, one new location I really want to travel to is South America. I want to experience the rich culture and the natural beauty of that continent.

  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:verdana;font-size:300%;"> Sports </h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:left;padding:20px">Aside from travel, sports are something I am maybe even more passionate about. From a young age, I played a variety of sports and it’s something that has become a part of my daily life. All through elementary school and high school, I played sports such as Rugby, Soccer, and Baseball. Just before Spring 2020, I broke my wrist and ultimately I couldn’t play baseball in the upcoming spring. However, Covid hit the world and all sports around the world were put on pause. In the meantime, I had to focus on making money and getting experience in the workforce to save up for my upcoming university tuition. Now in the present, my love for sports hasn’t faded whatsoever. I am an avid Soccer and Baseball fan and I have travelled the world to view and support teams from these 2 sports. I still play and compete in these 2 sports when the time is available and I will continue to for the rest of my life. Here are some short descriptions for the images below 1. Baseball 2019, 2. Rugby 2018, 3. Skiing with family, 4. Tottenham Hotspur game 2022 in London, 5. MLB game in Cleveland, Ohio 6. MLB game in New York CIty.
